# Hand Pose Recognition

This project implements real-time hand pose recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

## Description

The Hand Pose Recognition project uses computer vision techniques to detect and track hand movements in real-time video streams. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and NumPy for numerical computations.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking
- Hand landmark detection
- Basic gesture recognition (placeholder - to be implemented)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-pose-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd hand-pose-recognition
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```
python hand_pose_recognition.py
```

Press 'ESC' to exit the application.

## Future Improvements

- Implement specific gesture recognition algorithms
- Add support for multiple hand tracking
- Improve performance and reduce latency
